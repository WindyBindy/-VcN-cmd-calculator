# download:
you must have or use vcn in WINDOWS TERMINAL in microsoft store "that is for using colors"
https://github.com/WindyBindy/-VcN-cmd-calculator/raw/refs/heads/main/vcn.jar<br/>
(to see faster updates u can clone github reposetory and u must run  `vcn\src\Main.java`)<br/>
also you can make in `C:` a folder that named ```script``` and than make in this folder a `vcn.txt` and put that file:<br/>
```
@echo off
java 'your path to java file in repository' %*
```

than rename this `.txt` file in `.bat` to make this working

and in terminal than type
```
setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\scripts"
```
<br/>
than you have posibility to start -Vcn with command `vcn`, and you can check vcn version also with command `vcn v`, vcn v command you must not make settings because in java file and in jar file thar is one script


### VCN-Velocity Console Nord
This is VCN2, I make a design of vcn2. The vcn2 console is like linux or git syntax.
```
